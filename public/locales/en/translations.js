Frontend is my thing, but I'm always prepared to learn more. I'm my bachelors in techonology from computer science, and I'm looking for a subject to finish my master's (Software Engineering and Digital Transformation). On my free time I like to go to gym, watch movies and solve all kinds of puzzles, from ARGs and coding puzzles to chess."
