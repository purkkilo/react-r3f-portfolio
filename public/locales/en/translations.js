    for web- and software development.
    My time in LUT university, and developing my own projects,
    has prepared me for many scenarios.
    Frontend is my thing, but I'm always prepared to learn more.
    I have my bachelor's in techonology from computer science,
    and I'm looking for a subject to finish my master's

    On my free time I like to go to gym, watch movies
    and solve all kinds of puzzles, from ARGs and coding puzzles to chess.`
